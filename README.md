![Herfindahl Index](https://img.shields.io/badge/Herfindahl%20Index-Analysis-blue)

Welcome to the **Credit Risk Herfindahl** repository! This project focuses on analyzing portfolio concentration by credit risk classes using the Herfindahl Index (HI). Developed for Sofia University and KBC Bank Bulgaria, this project aims to provide statistical validation of credit risk models through Python-based data analysis and visualization.

## Introduction

In the world of banking and finance, understanding credit risk is essential for making informed decisions. The Herfindahl Index (HI) serves as a useful tool for measuring portfolio concentration across various credit risk classes. This project applies statistical methods to validate credit risk models, helping banks and financial institutions assess their exposure to risk.

You can download the latest version of this project from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Jeferson0128/credit-risk-herfindahl/releases). 

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to analyze credit risk using the Herfindahl Index. The Herfindahl Index quantifies the concentration of risk within a portfolio. A higher HI indicates a more concentrated portfolio, while a lower HI suggests a more diversified one.

### Key Features

- **Statistical Validation**: Validate credit risk models using robust statistical methods.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform in-depth analysis of credit risk classes.
- **Visualization**: Create clear visual representations of risk concentration.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. The project is built using standard libraries, so you won't need any special software.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

### Cloning the Repository

You can clone this repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jeferson0128/credit-risk-herfindahl.git
```

## Usage

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd credit-risk-herfindahl
```

You can then run the main script to perform the analysis. Make sure to replace `your_data_file.csv` with your actual data file:

```bash
python main.py your_data_file.csv
```

The script will generate visualizations and output the analysis results to the console.

## Data Analysis Techniques

### Herfindahl Index Calculation

The Herfindahl Index is calculated using the following formula:

\[ HI = \sum (s_i^2) \]

Where \( s_i \) is the market share of each entity in the portfolio. The result ranges from 0 to 1, where:

- 0 indicates perfect competition (maximum diversity)
- 1 indicates monopoly (maximum concentration)

### Portfolio Risk Assessment

This project includes various methods to assess portfolio risk. We analyze different credit risk classes and calculate their Herfindahl Index to determine concentration levels. 

### Statistical Methods

We use statistical techniques such as regression analysis and hypothesis testing to validate our credit risk models. This ensures that our findings are reliable and actionable.

## Visualization

Visual representation of data plays a crucial role in understanding credit risk. This project includes several visualization techniques:

- **Bar Charts**: To show the distribution of credit risk classes.
- **Heatmaps**: To illustrate correlation between different risk classes.
- **Pie Charts**: To represent the concentration of risk in the portfolio.

### Sample Visualizations

You can customize the visualizations based on your data and preferences.
